# Data types in JavaScript : 
First of all JavaScript is not like other languages c/c++ where data type is mandatory while declaring a varibale. JavaScript is a loosely typed language and that makes it comparatively flexible to other languges. We don't need to explicitly define data type while declaration but data type exists in JavaScript. JavaScript provides multiple data type to hold multiple types of values.

## In JavaScript data types are catogrized into two major chunks : -

* Primitive data type
* Non-primitive data type

### Primitive data type in JavaScript 
Predefined data types provided by JavaScript are known as primitive data types.They are of 5 types.

1. Number - Respresents numeric values.
1. String - Represents sequence of characters.
1. Boolean - Represents either true and false.
1. undefined - Represents undefined value. By default every variable is declared as undefined.
1. null - Represents no value at all.
1. BigInt - Represents big integer that are out of range for Number.


### Non-primitive data types in JavaScript
Data types that are defined with the help of pimitive data types. There is only one non-primitive data type.

1. Object - It includes arrays,maps,set & functions.



### Note - We can use typeof operator to check the data type of a variable.
